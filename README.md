# CSC337FinalProject

This project uses node.js and express.js.
To run it, both need to be installed.
This also uses MongoDB for databases and that needs to be installed.
Ensure that MongoDB is running and the proper address is entered into line #7 of server.js.
Currently, it is set to run on localhost.

The home page will just be localhost:8080/.
